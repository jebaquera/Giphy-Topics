# Giphy-Topics
<bold>A site with topics and gifs pulled using the Giphy API.</bold>
<br />
The site contains button topics that have a Tropical theme to them. You can select from any of the pre-constructed search buttons to receive up to 10 animated GIFs for that particular topic. 
<br />
Clicking on one of the search items will animate the GIF. As well, you can hover over the GIF to animate it.
<br />
I have set the rating value to "g". With this rating you should expect returns rated with either "y" or "g".
