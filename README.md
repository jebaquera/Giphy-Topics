# Giphy-Topics
<em>A site with topics and gifs pulled using the Giphy API.</em>
<br /><hr />
• The site contains button topics that have a Tropical theme to them. You can select from any of the pre-constructed search buttons to receive up to 10 animated GIFs for that particular topic. 
<br /><br />
• Clicking on one of the search items will animate the GIF. As well, you can hover over the GIF to animate it.
<br /><br />
• If you would like to add a topic to this list, simply enter a topic within the "Add Your Tropical Theme" text field and hit "Add Theme". You will now be shown a button with that text search that you entered. 
<br /><br />
• Clicking on that button will return matching search results. I have set the rating value for my search criteria to "g". With this rating you should expect returns rated with either a "y" or "g".
